# Multi-Task Transformer Architecture and Training Strategy

## Quick Start with Docker

```bash
# Build the image
# This creates a containerized environment with all necessary dependencies including:
# - PyTorch and related ML libraries
# - CUDA support for GPU acceleration
# - Required Python packages and system dependencies
docker build -t mtl_transformer .

# Run the container
# This initializes the transformer model in an isolated environment
# ensuring consistent behavior across different systems
docker run mtl_transformer
```

## 1. Sentence Transformer Architecture Decisions

The `SentenceTransformer` class implements several sophisticated architectural choices beyond the transformer backbone. This class serves as the foundation for our multi-task learning system:

```python
class SentenceTransformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, model_name: str = "roberta-base", freeze_backbone: bool = False):
        self.encoder = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.1)
        
    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
        outputs = self.encoder(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
        cls_output = outputs.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :]  # CLS token
        return self.dropout(cls_output)
```

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **CLS Token Selection**
   - Uses first token (`[:,0,:]`) of last hidden state as sentence representation
   - Comprehensive advantages over alternatives:
     - Significantly more computationally efficient than mean/max pooling operations
       * Requires only a single index operation instead of computing across all tokens
       * Reduces memory bandwidth requirements during forward and backward passes
       * Enables faster training and inference
     - Maintains comprehensive sentence-level context
       * CLS token attends to all other tokens through self-attention
       * Captures long-range dependencies effectively
       * Learns hierarchical relationships between tokens
     - Provides single vector representation ideal for classification
       * Fixed dimensionality regardless of input length
       * Dense semantic representation of entire sequence
       * Simplified downstream task architecture
     - Maintains consistency with BERT-style pretraining
       * Leverages pretrained knowledge effectively
       * Enables better transfer learning
       * Reduces training instability
     - Facilitates gradient flow during backpropagation
       * Direct path to loss function
       * Reduces vanishing gradient problems
       * Enables more stable training
     - Memory efficient implementation
       * Reduces GPU memory requirements
       * Enables larger batch sizes
       * Improves training throughput

2. **Dropout Implementation**
   - Strategic 0.1 dropout rate applied after CLS token extraction
   - Comprehensive rationale:
     - Prevents overfitting on sentence representations
       * Introduces controlled noise during training
       * Forces robust feature learning
       * Improves generalization
     - Applied post-pooling for maximum efficiency
       * Reduces computational overhead
       * Maintains regularization benefits
       * Simplifies gradient computation
     - Maintains consistent regularization across tasks
       * Enables stable multi-task learning
       * Prevents task-specific overfitting
       * Facilitates knowledge sharing
     - Carefully chosen dropout rate balances:
       * Model capacity utilization
       * Regularization strength
       * Training stability
     - Position after CLS token ensures:
       * Maximum impact on final predictions
       * Efficient computation
       * Effective regularization
     - Creates implicit ensemble effect:
       * Multiple different subnetworks during training
       * Improved robustness
       * Better generalization
     - Prevents co-adaptation of features:
       * Forces independent feature learning
       * Improves feature robustness
       * Enables better transfer learning

## 2. Multi-Task Architecture Adaptations

The architecture incorporates several sophisticated changes to support efficient multi-task learning:

    def __init__(self, model_name: str, num_classes_task_a: int = 4,
                 sentiment_classes: int = 3):
        # Shared backbone
        self.sentence_transformer = SentenceTransformer(model_name, freeze_backbone)
        hidden_size = self.sentence_transformer.encoder.config.hidden_size
        
        # Task-specific heads with identical architecture
        self.task_a_head = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Dropout(0.1),
